# WebDev-Tasks

Frontend development is all about practicing and learning the different frameworks, libraries and systems. This web-app is aimed at frontend developers who wish to improve their skills by practicing coding UI elements like buttons, forms, etc., and figuring out the different ways these elements can be created by using various libraries and frameworks.  We wish to motivate beginners to explore the field of web development by actually doing and searching the methods of coding a website.

This project is built using the MERN stack.<br>

## How to Use <br>

<div width="200px"> 

![basicUI](./assets/basicUI.jpeg)<br>
</div>

1. The top “Current Task” bar would be controlled by the backend, new tasks will be pushed regularly for the developers to practice.
2. Interested developers can practice their skills by participating in the task. Eg: first task is to make their own button on the front page wich will redirect to /dashboard/student_name.

<h3>* This is a rough user flow upon which the project will be built. The feature-set and the code are subject to changes *</h3><br>
